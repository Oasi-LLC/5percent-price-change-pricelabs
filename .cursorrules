# CRITICAL SAFETY RULES FOR CODE CHANGES

1. DIFF COMPLIANCE
- Follow diffs EXACTLY, character by character
- Only modify lines explicitly shown in the diff
- Never touch code outside the diff's scope
- Never "improve" or "modernize" code not in diff
- Never change API endpoints or authentication methods
- If a file isn't in the diff, don't modify it

2. CORE PROTECTIONS
- Treat working code as sacred
- No creative interpretation of diffs
- No additional "helpful" changes
- No changing of functional logic
- No modifying of API integrations
- No updating of dependencies or versions

3. CHANGE BOUNDARIES
- If removing line X, only remove line X
- If adding line Y, only add line Y
- If modifying line Z, only change what's shown
- Keep all other code exactly as is
- Maintain existing whitespace and formatting
- Preserve all comments not explicitly changed

4. SAFETY PROTOCOLS
- When in doubt, ask first
- Never assume improvements are needed
- Report potential issues instead of fixing
- Require explicit confirmation for any extra changes
- Stop and ask if diff seems incomplete
- Flag any safety concerns before proceeding

5. FORBIDDEN ACTIONS
- No "modernizing" working code
- No changing API endpoints
- No modifying authentication
- No updating working functions
- No adding new features
- No removing "old" code
